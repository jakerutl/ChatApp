This is a chatapp that we built together in class but just styled while also adding some more functions like typing.. showing up with someone starts to type.
 -->

<!-- How to use:
-If you haven't already, go to this folders directory in the terminal, npm install, cd examples/chat, npm install, then finally npm start.
- To use sass simply get your way to the folder in terminal and type in grunt watch. This will active sass.
- To view this folder in a browser, go to the terminal and type in node app. That will in simple terms "turn it on". Once this is done go to a browser and type in localhost:3000 in the url.
- To stop both node app, and grunt watch simply hit control c. And to quickly start it back up press the up key and enter. -->
